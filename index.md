I am Van Nguyen, a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the Department of Software Systems & Cybersecurity at Monash University, Australia, under the supervision of Prof [Carsten Rudolph](https://research.monash.edu/en/persons/carsten-rudolph). I am also an Affiliate at CSIRO’s Data61, Australia. I completed my PhD in Computer Science at Monash University in 2021, under the supervision of Prof [Dinh Phung](https://research.monash.edu/en/persons/dinh-phung) and Dr [Trung Le](https://research.monash.edu/en/persons/trung-le). My thesis, "Deep Learning for Software Security", can be accessed [here](https://bridges.monash.edu/articles/thesis/Deep_Learning_for_Software_Security/13728244?file=26374492). In the same year, I was recognized as a global talent through Australia’s Global Talent Independent Program (GTI), thanks to the recommendation of Prof [John Grundy](https://sites.google.com/site/johncgrundy/).

To date, I have 5+ years of experience in computer science, data science, cybersecurity, and software engineering. My contributions to these areas have resulted in 20+ publications in esteemed conferences and journals in machine learning and software engineering, including ESEC/FSE, ICLR, TSE, TOSEM, KDD, IJCNN, PAKDD, ASIACCS, and UAI.

My current research focuses on advancing machine learning and deep learning approaches to solve topical problems in network and software security, including out-of-distribution code identification in software systems, robust and multilingual software vulnerability detection with explanations, transparent and reliable automated vulnerability repair, and enhancing large language models (LLMs) for practical and secure code generation, aiming for safer and more reliable software development processes and broader security systems. My long-term research goal is to advance AI systems to perform complex human learning, explanation, and reasoning, enabling more intelligent, adaptive, and efficient solutions.


Alongside my expertise in theories and methodologies of computer science, data science, cybersecurity, and software engineering, I have solid programming and technical skills, with proficiency in Python and a variety of libraries such as TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch, Scikit-learn, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Hugging Face for data analysis and implementing machine learning, deep learning, and large language models. I am also experienced in Power BI, SQL, C/C++, R, Linux, and CUDA.

### Selected News

[*May 2025*] I am thrilled to share that our paper, "SAFE: A Novel Approach For Software Vulnerability Detection from Enhancing The Capability of Large Language Models", has been accepted at the 20th ACM ASIA Conference on Computer and Communications Security (***ACM ASIACCS 2025***), ***one of the top conferences in cybersecurity***. In this work, we propose an innovative approach to enhance the capability of large language models in learning the semantic and syntactic relationships within source code, enabling more robust software vulnerability detection. I am deeply grateful to my collaborators for their invaluable feedback and support throughout this research.

[*Mar 2025*] I am excited to share that, with the support of Monash University, my proposal titled *"Robust and Adaptive AI-driven Solutions for Software Development and Quality Assurance"* has been submitted to the Australian Research Council (ARC) Discovery Early Career Researcher Award (DECRA) 2026. This project aims to create innovative solutions to address the limitations of current methods in software development and quality assurance practices. Ultimately, the solutions help create scalable, high-quality, secure, and adaptive software with minimal operational costs while preventing catastrophic system failures and financial losses caused by software vulnerabilities.

[*Jan 2025*] I am delighted to announce that our paper, "AI2TALE: An Innovative Information Theory-based Approach for Learning to Localize Phishing Attacks", has been accepted at the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR 2025, ***Rank: A\****). In this work, we propose an innovative deep learning-based method to solve the phishing attack localization problem, with the aim of improving the explainability (transparency) of email phishing detection. Our proposed method is lightweight, effective, and practical. Leading this work as the first and corresponding author has been an incredibly rewarding experience. I am grateful to my collaborators for their valuable feedback throughout this research.

[*Dec 2024*] For my role as Head Teaching Associate for the Deep Learning unit (with nearly 300 students enrolled) in the Department of Data Science and AI at Monash University, my teaching received a "very high" student satisfaction rating of 90/100, according to the Teaching Evaluation Report.

[*Aug 2024*] The research proposal, "Continual Learning of Large Language Models for Version-Controlled Code Generation", in collaboration with my colleagues Dr [Trang Vu](https://research.monash.edu/en/persons/trang-vu) and Dr [Tongtong Wu](https://research.monash.edu/en/persons/tongtong-wu), secure the Monash FIT Early Career Academics Seed Grant.

[*May 2024*] I had the privilege of serving as a guest lecturer for the Software Security unit in the Department of Software Systems and Cybersecurity at the Faculty of Information Technology, Monash University, where I presented current challenges and cutting-edge solutions in software security.

[Apr 2024] I was pleased to share that our paper, "Deep Domain Adaptation with Max-Margin Principle for Cross-Project Imbalanced Software Vulnerability Detection", was accepted in ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology (TOSEM), a prestigious ***Q1-ranked*** journal in software engineering. In this paper, we propose an innovative solution that leverages solid theories of kernel methods and deep domain adaptation for cross-project imbalanced software vulnerability detection. It has been a truly rewarding experience to lead this work as the first and corresponding author. I sincerely appreciate the insightful feedback and support from my collaborators throughout this research.
